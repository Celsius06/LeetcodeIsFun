# LeetCode Solutions in Java

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode solutions, primarily implemented in **Java**! This repository is intended to help others understand and solve coding problems, with solutions organized by topic and complexity.

## üìÇ Repository Structure

- Each solution is stored in its own directory under a relevant topic folder.
- Each solution includes:
  - **Java Code**: Clean, efficient Java code for the solution.
  - **Explanation**: Detailed problem analysis and approach.
  - **Complexity Analysis**: Space and time complexities.
  - **Example Walkthroughs**: To clarify the solution process.

## üìò Topics Covered

| Topic           | Description                            |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Arrays          | Solutions involving array manipulations |
| Strings         | Solutions for string-based challenges |
| Linked Lists    | Problems related to singly/doubly linked lists |
| Trees           | Solutions covering binary trees, BSTs, etc. |
| Dynamic Programming | Problems solved using DP approaches |
| Graphs          | Graph traversal and pathfinding solutions |
| ...             | More topics as I progress!            |
