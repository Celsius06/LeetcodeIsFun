# LeetCodeIsFun

Welcome to my repository of LeetCode solutions, primarily implemented in **Java**! This repository is intended to help others understand and solve coding problems, with solutions organized by topic and complexity.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

- Each solution is stored in its own directory under a relevant topic folder.
- Each solution includes:
  - **Java Code**: Clean, efficient Java code for the solution.
  - **Explanation**: Detailed problem analysis and approach.
  - **Complexity Analysis**: Space and time complexities.
  - **Example Walkthroughs**: To clarify the solution process.

## ðŸ“˜ Topics Covered

| Topic           | Description                            |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| Arrays          | Solutions involving array manipulations |
| Strings         | Solutions for string-based challenges |
| Linked Lists    | Problems related to singly/doubly linked lists |
| Trees           | Solutions covering binary trees, BSTs, etc. |
| Dynamic Programming | Problems solved using DP approaches |
| Graphs          | Graph traversal and pathfinding solutions |
| ...             | More topics as I progress!            |

## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Celsius06/LeetcodeIsFun.git
   cd LeetcodeIsFun
   ```

2. **Look For Your Problem**: Navigate through folders to find specific topics.
3. **View Explanations**: Each solution has a markdown file with an explanation, making it easier to understand the approach and complexity.

## ðŸ“„ Solution Format

Each solution is structured as follows:

### Solution File
- **Java Code**: Located in `Solution.java`
- **Explanation**: Details the approach, edge cases, and solution thought process.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Summarizes time and space complexities.

### Example File Structure
