# [3066. Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value II](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-exceed-threshold-value-ii/)
## Problem Description
Given an array of integers and a threshold value, the task is to find the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the array elements exceed the threshold. In one operation, you can increment any element of the array by 1.

## Examples
### Example 1
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3], threshold = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: Increment the elements as follows: [1, 2, 3] -> [2, 2, 3] -> [3, 2, 3] -> [4, 2, 3] -> [4, 3, 3]. The sum is now 10.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: nums = [1, 1, 1], threshold = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Increment the elements as follows: [1, 1, 1] -> [2, 1, 1] -> [2, 2, 1]. The sum is now 5.
```

## Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `1 <= threshold <= 10^9`

// + Time: O(n * log(n)) where n is the number of elements in the input array.
// + Space: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array.

class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        // PriorityQueue to store the numbers in ascending order.
        // Using Long to avoid potential overflow when computing (x * 2 + y).
        PriorityQueue<Long> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int x : nums) {
            // Add each number as a long value into the priority queue.
            pq.offer((long) x);
        }

        int ans = 0; // Counter for the number of operations performed.

        // Continue performing operations while:
        // - There are at least two elements in the queue, and
        // - The smallest element in the queue is less than k.
        for (; pq.size() > 1 && pq.peek() < k; ++ans) {
            // Remove the two smallest elements.
            long x = pq.poll(), y = pq.poll();
            // According to the problem's operation:
            // new value = 2 * x + y (since x <= y due to the min-heap property).
            pq.offer(x * 2 + y);
        }

        // Return the total number of operations performed.
        return ans;
    }
}
